🟨 STAR Method – 810 Rejection Automation Using VBA

✅ Situation

As part of our EDI operations, we were manually reviewing and analyzing 810 invoice rejection logs in Excel. Each row contained complex, multiline data, and team members had to:

Manually extract error descriptions,

Identify vendors, invoices, and error types,

Cross-reference SOP rules,

And finally categorize each issue as “matched” or “unmatched” for resolution.


This was not only time-consuming (30–60 minutes daily) but also prone to human errors and inconsistencies in resolution tagging.


---

✅ Task

I took the initiative to automate the end-to-end rejection categorization process using VBA scripting in Excel.
The goal was to:

Extract structured information from unstructured text,

Match it against SOP rules,

Populate status and resolution, and

Highlight matched/unmatched entries with formatting and reporting — all with a single click or sheet update.



---

✅ Action

I developed a two-part VBA automation system:

1. Trigger Setup

Created a Worksheet_Change event in the SOP_ERRORS sheet to automatically trigger the process when the data was updated in columns A to J.


2. Core Logic in ProcessErrors Macro

Loaded both DB Errors and SOP Errors into memory.

Used Regular Expressions (RegEx) to:

Extract Error Type from lines containing Error#

Pull Vendor names from Vendor# lines

Capture Invoice# for identification


Implemented a dictionary-based lookup from the SOP sheet to classify each issue.

Automatically populated the following fields in each row:

📌 Description (compiled view of 10 columns)

📌 Error Type

📌 Vendor Name

📌 Invoice Number

📌 Match Status

📌 Resolution Comments (from SOP)


Applied:

Color-based conditional formatting for quick visual feedback (Green = matched, Red = unmatched),

Column width adjustments, wrapping, and borders for neatness.


Final touch: added freeze panes and a message box confirmation at the end for user-friendliness.

✅ Result

🔄 Time savings: Manual effort reduced from 45–60 minutes to under 5 minutes per batch.

🧠 Error-prone steps eliminated: Human interpretation of SOPs replaced by rule-based automation.

📊 Standardized outputs: Rejection logs are now consistent, organized, and presentation-ready.

👍 Adopted by team: Used across EDI team for multiple trading partners and invoice batches.

📈 Scalable: Easy to extend with more error types, partners, or SOP rules.

🎯 BONUS SLIDE / TALKING POINTS

Next Steps:

Convert to Python or Power Automate for cross-platform use

Store logs in centralized database (SQL/SharePoint)

Automate email dispatch of matched/unmatched reports
